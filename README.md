My name is Leandro Canha, and I am a Software Engineering student. From an early age, I have always been passionate about technology and helping people, something I consider my greatest passion. With familiarity in languages such as Java, Python, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and JavaScript, I always strive to combine my technical skills with the desire to create solutions that make a difference in people's daily lives.
